## THINGS TO CONSIDER

###

Transporting editor content and generating images from it is a functional solution; however, the image quality could be improved. While scaling the image to a higher resolution and resizing it back enhances clarity to some extent, it does not fully achieve the desired level of quality. A more effective and scalable approach would be to translate the HTML content into DOCX-compatible XML with placeholders for dynamic content insertion.

On the other hand, this method requires careful consideration to ensure all HTML elements and their associated styles from the editor are accurately represented in the DOCX format. This ensures that the final document maintains the fidelity and styling of the original content.
